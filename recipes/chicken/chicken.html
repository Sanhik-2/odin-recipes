        <p>Dhal Puri is a type of flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent, particularly popular in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. It is made from a combination of yellow split peas (dhal) and wheat flour, resulting in a flavorful and hearty bread. Dhal Puri is typically served with various curries, stews, or chutneys and is a staple in Indo-Caribbean cuisine.</p>
        <p>Here's the recipe: </p>
        <ol>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ol>
            <li>1 cup yellow split peas (dhal), soaked for at least 2 hours</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>   
            <li>3/4 cup warm water (adjust as needed)</li>
        </ol>
            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>
            <li>Drain the soaked yellow split peas and rinse them well.</li>
            <li>In a food processor, combine the split peas, turmeric powder, cumin seeds, and salt. Pulse until you get a coarse mixture. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt. Add the vegetable oil and warm water. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and roll each portion into a ball.</li>
            <li>Roll out each ball into a thin circle, about 6-8 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Spoon a portion of the split pea mixture onto the center of each rolled-out dough circle. Fold the edges over the filling and pinch to seal.</li>   
            <li>Gently roll out the filled dough again into a flat circle, being careful not to tear it.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook each Dhal Puri for about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown spots appear.</li>
            <li>Remove from the skillet and keep warm in a clean towel. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.</li>
